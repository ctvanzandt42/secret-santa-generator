<h1>Secret Santa Generator</h1>

In order to run this application locally, you will need to be running Python3 and have the following packages
installed locally:

`pip install pyyaml`

The configurations are read from a local YAML file ignored by Git, and the data for the list of participants
is read from a local CSV file. To build locally, the file should be blank, except for the data. 

In addition, an application password will need to be created in order to send emails locally.
